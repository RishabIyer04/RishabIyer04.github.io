        <h1>NBA 2023-2024 Visualization</h1>
        <p>
            In the NBA, there are 5 positions in the game: 
            Point Guard (PG), Shooting Guard (SG), Small Forward (SF), Power Forward (PF), Center (C)
            All these positions play vital roles in the game. However, no matter how productive a player is on the court,
            as a player ages, they will eventually lose their ability to score more efficiently. However, how much of a factor 
            does age play into a player's PTS (points per game) on the court. That's what this visualization is here to find out.

        <h1>PG: Age vs PTS</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first scene shows the correlation between Age and scoring production in the form of Points per Game (PTS) for NBA players who play the Point Guard position.</li>
                <li>The horizontal axis represents the Age of the player, and the PTS represents the Points per game they scored for the regular season.</li>
                <li>As you can see, there seems to be a bigger variation of data between the age range 19-30 than the age range 31-40.</li>
                <li>For example, within the 19-30 age range, 24 year old Luka DonciÄ‡ scores 33.9 Points per game, which is significantly higher than the 36 year old Step Curry, who scores 26.4 Points per game.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Tip: Hover over each data point to get a read on their name, age, position, PTS, and their 2P's and 3P's per game.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>The second scene shows the correlation between Age and scoring production in the form of Points per Game (PTS) for NBA players who play the Small Forward position.</li>
            <li>The horizontal axis represents the Age of the player, and the PTS represents the Points per game they scored for the regular season.</li>
            <li>The data presented here shows that there is a large amount of Small Forwards within the age range 19-30 than the age range 31-40.</li>
            <li>However, the interesting part is that the players with the highest PTS are within the age range of 31-40, that being people like Kawhi Leonard and DeMar DeRozan.</li>

                <li>The third scene shows the correlation between Age and scoring production in the form of Points per Game (PTS) for NBA players who play the Center position.</li>
                <li>The horizontal axis represents the Age of the player, and the PTS represents the Points per game they scored for the regular season.</li>
                <li>The data presented here shows that there is a hugely disproportionate amount of Centers within the age range 19-30 compared to the age range 31-40. In fact, there's a heavy concentration of players within the 23-26 age range.</li>
                <li>29 year old Joel Embiid stands at the top with 34.7 PTS. But the average NBA center based on the graph will be hard pressed to make it past 15 PTS.</li>

            Let's play around with the scatter plot and compare how different positions perform based on their age.
            Other stuff.
